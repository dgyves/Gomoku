# Gomoku
Gomoku mobile application made in collaboration with Matthew Thiesen.
The app will allow for selection of either local two-person multiplayer, or a single-player game against an AI. Throughout the game the user will have the option to save the game state (and given the option to either begin a new game, or resume a saved one). Once the game is completed, the option will be given to share a screenshot of the final result with one of the userâ€™s contacts.
